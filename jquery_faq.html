        <dt>Fun Fact 1. The most popular National Park is...</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United
            States – attracting more than 11 million visitors in 2018. That’s almost twice the number of visitors as the
            second most popular national park. Located in Tennessee and North Carolina, the Smokies are known for their
            great biodiversity and spectacular firefly displays in the late spring.

        <dt>Fun Fact 2. How Grand is the Grand Canyon?.</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">
            An estimated 5.9 million people visit the Grand Canyon each year, making it the second most visited national
            park behind the Great Smoky Mountains. We know a ton of Grand Canyon national park facts. Our guests often
            ask about the size, age, and location of this stunning national park.

        <dd class="invisible"> Believe it or not, the Grand Canyon is located entirely in the state of Arizona covering
            277 miles in length
            with canyons over a mile in depth. The beginnings of the Grand Canyon, however, are much debated by
            scientists. Did the Colorado River carve the whole canyon or was there an ancient gorge already waiting for
            the new river over 6 million years ago?
